# Introduction

Welcome to our project documentation.

During our course at H5, we were challenged with a bunch of different tasks, and we built an API for each one to make things smoother. Think of this documentation as your go-to guide for understanding how each part of our project works and how you can use it for your own projects.

## Why Document Our APIs?

- **Educational Insight**: These APIs serve as a detailed record of our learning process and the solutions we developed for each task. Theyâ€™re here to show how we tackled different challenges and what we learned along the way.
- **Feedback and Improvement**: By documenting our APIs, we provide an opportunity for feedback. This helps us improve and refine our approaches, benefiting from insights that others might offer.
